École 42 Piscine OCaml - 2 week intensive study in OCaml

### About the project
* This is a piscine on OCAML at [École 42](https://42.fr).
* A piscine is a 2-week intensive learning in a specific topic. There are new assignments every weekday and on the weekends there are group projects. 
	* day00 - basics
	* day01 - functions
	* day02 - pattern matching, types
	* day03 - ecosystem
	* day04 - modular programming
	* rush00 - tic tac toe
	* day05 - impertive programming 
	* day06 - functor
	* day07 - object oriented programming
	* day08 - object oriented programming
    * day09 - monoid, monad
* I put the subjects of each day in their directories.
* Total score 125/100 (the extra 25 points are bonus).
* I want to learn monoid and monad concept on day09 so I took the time and didn't do rush01

### How to run the codes
* Most of the code can be compiled with this command.
	```ocamlopt```
* I also have Makefile in some assignment.
